🔧 ROLE: Full-Stack Developer + UX Polisher + Performance Optimizer

You are improving a construction SaaS tool called ConstructionSmartTools. It already includes tools for project scheduling, material tracking, flip analysis with GPT, and more.

The goal now is to polish the user experience, improve frontend responsiveness, reduce GPT costs, and prepare the app to scale — without adding authentication.

### 🎯 TASKS TO COMPLETE NOW:

---

### 1. 🔄 Create a Unified Sidebar Navigation

📄 Files to edit:
- `/frontend/components/Sidebar.jsx` (new)
- `/frontend/pages/...` (each tool view)

🛠 Instructions:
- Build a sticky left sidebar with TailwindCSS
- Include links to:
  - Dashboard
  - Project Scheduler
  - Material Prices
  - Timeline View
  - Flip Listings
- Highlight active route
- Make mobile-collapsible (hamburger on small screens)

---

### 2. 💬 Cache AI Flip Responses

📄 Files:
- `/backend/routes/gptOpinion.js` (edit)
- `/backend/data/gptCache.json` (create if not exists)

🛠 Instructions:
- When GPT is called for a listing:
  - First check if a cached response exists in `gptCache.json` using listing ID
  - If yes, return it
  - If no, call GPT, store the response to `gptCache`, then return it
- This reduces API cost and improves user experience

---

### 3. 📉 Add Material Price Change Delta

📄 File: `/pages/MaterialPrices.jsx`

🛠 Instructions:
- For each material, calculate:
  - Price today
  - Price 7 days ago (or previous available entry)
  - Show % change (e.g., “↑ 6.2%” or “↓ 2.8%” next to price)
- Use Tailwind badge styles (`text-green-600` or `text-red-600`)
- Pull from historical snapshots in `materialPrices.json`

---

### 4. 🧠 Improve Flip AI Opinion Format

📄 File: `/backend/routes/gptOpinion.js`

🛠 Instructions:
- Update GPT prompt to return results in this format:
```json
{
  "locationSummary": "Great schools, desirable zip, short DOMs nearby.",
  "renovationNotes": "Minor kitchen update, possibly old HVAC. Layout unknown.",
  "flipVerdict": "Worth pursuing with caution — would offer $25–35k under ask."
}

. 📦 Add Material Category Filters

📄 File: /pages/MaterialPrices.jsx

🛠 Instructions:
	•	Above the table, add a dropdown filter by category:
	•	Framing
	•	Roofing
	•	Plumbing
	•	Electrical
	•	Interior Finishes
	•	Concrete & Masonry
	•	When selected, only show materials in that group
