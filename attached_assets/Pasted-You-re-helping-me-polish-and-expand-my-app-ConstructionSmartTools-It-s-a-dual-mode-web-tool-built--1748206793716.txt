You're helping me polish and expand my app ConstructionSmartTools. It's a dual-mode web tool (built in Node.js + Express with Tailwind + Vanilla JS frontend) for homeowners evaluating renovations and small construction business owners managing bids, tasks, and clients.

My GitHub: https://github.com/sgottshall1997/ConstructionSmartTools

I want you to implement the following updates directly into the codebase:

---

### 1. CONSUMER UX POLISH
- Improve the Homeowner Dashboard layout:
  - Add a clear heading: ‚ÄúYour Project Planner‚Äù
  - Create sidebar quick links: ‚ÄúStart New Estimate‚Äù, ‚ÄúAsk the AI Assistant‚Äù, ‚ÄúCompare Contractors‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrack Your Project‚Äù
  - Add helpful microcopy/tooltips near major buttons
- Add visual layout enhancements (using Tailwind):
  - Use Heroicons or Tabler Icons for navigation and action buttons
  - Center key widgets and add light card backgrounds for each tool/module

---

### 2. NEW FEATURES
- Add a ‚ÄúProject Tracker‚Äù tool for homeowners:
  - Simple multi-step checklist: ["Estimate Sent", "Contractor Selected", "Permit Filed", "In Progress", "Complete"]
  - Allow user to click to mark progress steps as complete
- On the Homeowner dashboard, mirror the AI Concierge & Assistant features that exist in the Pro version
  - Add a simple prompt box ‚Üí POSTs to existing backend AI endpoints
  - Display GPT responses in a styled result card

---

### 3. SMART AUTOMATIONS
- Implement Nodemailer to send:
  - Confirmation email when a bid is generated
  - Reminder email when a permit is filed with due date
- Integrate Google Maps API for ZIP code form fields:
  - When user enters ZIP, autofill city/state
  - Validate ZIP location

---

### 4. MONETIZATION SETUP (BETA)
- Scaffold a basic freemium logic layer:
  - Track number of uses per tool (per session using localStorage)
  - After 3 uses, prompt for email signup with placeholder modal
  - Add a Stripe-ready placeholder for Pro features (don‚Äôt build full checkout yet)

---

### 5. REPO IMPROVEMENTS
- Write a polished README.md with:
  - Project summary
  - Tech stack
  - How to run it locally
  - Screenshots
  - Demo video placeholder
  - Roadmap bullets
- Add a new `/docs/roadmap.md` file that tracks features with:
  - ‚úÖ Done
  - üîß In Progress
  - ‚ùå Not Started

---

### 6. DEMO & DEPLOYMENT SETUP
- Add a seed data script or ‚ÄúDemo Mode‚Äù toggle that:
  - Auto-fills a sample project for homeowners and pros
  - Lets me showcase both dashboards with mock data
- Recommend easiest live deployment (Render or Replit Hosting)

Make all changes clean and modular. Do not break current routing logic. Use Tailwind utility classes for styling and keep JS readable. Be sure to test each tool after changes.
