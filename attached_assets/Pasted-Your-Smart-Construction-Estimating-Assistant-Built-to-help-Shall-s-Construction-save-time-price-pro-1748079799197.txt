🔍 What This Tool Does

This tool helps you create accurate, professional project estimates in just a few minutes. It walks you through a step-by-step form and then generates:
	•	A detailed cost estimate
	•	A breakdown of labor and material costs
	•	Comparisons to past jobs you’ve done
	•	A downloadable PDF proposal
	•	A ready-to-send client email

Everything is designed to work like your brain already does — just faster, more consistent, and with fewer mistakes.

✍️ How It Works – Step by Step
	1.	You Fill Out a Project Form
	•	Enter the square footage, project type (kitchen, bath, addition), materials, labor, and other job details.
	•	As you fill it out, the tool gives helpful advice like:
“Quartz costs around $50 per square foot but installs faster than marble.”
	2.	The Tool Calculates the Estimate
	•	It takes your inputs and calculates:
	•	Labor cost (based on hours and workers)
	•	Material cost (based on what you selected)
	•	Timeline and site complexity
	•	Permit/inspection factors
	3.	You Get a Full Estimate Breakdown
	•	You see a clean breakdown by category:
	•	Labor, materials, overhead, permits
	•	Cost per square foot
	•	Risk rating for the job (ex: “Tight timeline may affect delivery”)
	4.	It Compares the Job to Past Projects
	•	Shows you similar jobs you’ve done (ex: “Willow Ave 2021 – 520 sq ft kitchen, $87,000”)
	•	Explains how the new job compares
	5.	You Can Export a PDF Proposal
	•	Looks professional with your logo
	•	Includes summary, cost breakdown, and comparison to other jobs
	•	Ready to hand to a client
	6.	It Writes the Email for You
	•	A professional, pre-written email is generated with the estimate:
“Hi Sarah, attached is your detailed kitchen remodel estimate. Let us know if you’d like to discuss any changes.”
