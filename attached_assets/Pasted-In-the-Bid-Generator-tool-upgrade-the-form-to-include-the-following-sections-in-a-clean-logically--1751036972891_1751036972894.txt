Please implement this in a modular format and ensure the UI allows toggling between basic mode (what currently exists) and ‚ÄúAdvanced Bid Mode‚Äù which reveals all the above.

Once added, verify all inputs are properly sent to the GPT endpoint for professional bid generation. If using promptFactory, ensure the backend passes these expanded fields into a richer AI prompt for detailed, contract-style output.
