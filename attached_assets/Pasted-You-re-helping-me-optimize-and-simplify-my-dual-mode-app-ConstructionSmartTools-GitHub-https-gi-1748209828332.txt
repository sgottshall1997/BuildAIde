You're helping me optimize and simplify my dual-mode app, ConstructionSmartTools (GitHub: https://github.com/sgottshall1997/ConstructionSmartTools). The app is written in Node.js + Express with a frontend in vanilla JavaScript + TailwindCSS.

I want you to consolidate overlapping tools, rename for clarity, and update the UI and backend logic accordingly across both Homeowner and Pro modes.

### 1. HOMEOWNER TOOL MERGES

#### ✅ Merge: “Cost Estimator” + “Budget Forecasting”
- Rename to: **Smart Project Estimator**
- What to include:
  - Inputs: Project type, square footage, finish level, timeline
  - Output: Total estimate (range), optional breakdown (labor, materials, timeline)
  - Add button: “Show Budget Forecast” → displays payment breakdown (Deposit, Mid-Project, Completion)
- Update the route, HTML, and sidebar label to reflect new name

#### ✅ Merge: “AI Concierge” + “AI Assistant”
- Rename to: **Renovation Assistant (AI)**
- Consolidate into one clean interface:
  - User input prompt field
  - GPT response area
  - Add suggested questions (e.g., “What’s a good budget for a bathroom remodel?”)
- Remove duplicate pages and routes for "concierge" or "assistant"

### 2. PRO MODE TOOL CLEANUPS

#### ✅ Merge: “Material Tracker” + “Subcontractor Manager”
- Rename to: **Logistics Dashboard**
- What to include:
  - Tabs or toggle between:
    - Subcontractors: Name, scope, availability, status
    - Materials: Name, supplier, quantity, ETA
- Combine into one clean dashboard with expandable sections

#### ✅ Merge: “Client Dashboard” + “Project Progress Tracker”
- Rename to: **Client & Project Hub**
- Features:
  - Table of all clients and their active projects
  - Project statuses (Not started, In Progress, Delayed, Complete)
  - Add simple progress bars or badges next to project status

#### ✅ Keep: “Estimate Generator” and “Invoice Builder” separate
- These are clear, high-utility tools
- Optionally link them: after creating an estimate, user can “Convert to Invoice”

### 3. UI & ROUTING CLEANUP

- Update all sidebar navigation labels to reflect new names
- Remove old/unused routes from the Express backend
- Consolidate and clean up any redundant JS files or templates
- Make sure all tools follow consistent layout (card-based, centered content, helpful titles)

---

### 4. BONUS POLISH

- On every main dashboard (Homeowner and Pro):
  - Show friendly welcome text (e.g., “Welcome back! What would you like to do today?”)
  - Add a quick-start widget: “Start a New Estimate”, “Ask the Assistant”, “Add New Project”

Be sure to keep the code modular and update references throughout. Don’t break existing logic — preserve form handling, but simplify where redundant.
