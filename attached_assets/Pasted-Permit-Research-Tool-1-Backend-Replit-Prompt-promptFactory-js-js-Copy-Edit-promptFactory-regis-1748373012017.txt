Permit Research Tool)
✅ 1. Backend Replit Prompt (promptFactory.js)
js
Copy
Edit
promptFactory.register("permitLookup", {
  system: "You are a building permit expert for residential projects. Output JSON listing permits and guidelines.",
  user: `Project: {{ProjectDescription}} at {{ProjectLocation}}. List required permits, estimated processing time, and any key notes. Assume local building codes apply.`
});
Inputs to capture:

ProjectDescription (e.g. “Second-story addition” or “Kitchen remodel with plumbing/electrical changes”)

ProjectLocation (address or just city + state)

Set temperature: 0.2
Parse GPT response with JSON.parse(), wrap in try/catch.

✅ 2. Expected Output Format
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "permits": ["Building Permit", "Electrical Permit", "Plumbing Permit"],
  "estimatedTime": "4–6 weeks",
  "notes": "Consult local city hall for exact processing fees and inspection timing."
}
This output lets you drop clean frontend tags, callouts, and alerts.

✅ 3. Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)
🏷 Permit Tags
jsx

Edit
<div className="mb-4">
  <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Required Permits</h2>
  {permits.map((p, idx) => (
    <span key={idx} className="bg-blue-200 text-blue-800 px-2 py-1 mr-2 rounded inline-block">{p}</span>
  ))}
</div>
⏳ Timeline + Notes Box
jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-blue-300 p-4 rounded">
  <p><strong>Estimated Processing Time:</strong> {estimatedTime}</p>
  <p className="mt-2">{notes}</p>
</div>
✅ 4. Error Handling & Fallbacks
If ProjectLocation is too vague (e.g. "USA"), GPT should return:
"Please provide a city and state for accurate permit lookup."

If notes are missing, you can append a fallback like:
"Permit rules vary by jurisdiction. Always confirm with your local building department."

If GPT returns prose, retry with:
"Return only a valid JSON object with keys: permits, estimatedTime, notes."

⭐ Optional Power Features
🔗 Link to Building Dept. Site: Based on location, link to permit PDFs or forms

📅 Calendar Reminder: “Set reminder to apply for permit on [start date]”

🧠 Persona-Aware Explanation:

Contractor: Use code references and terms like “submittal set”

Homeowner: “You’ll likely need an electrician’s sign-off before inspection.”
