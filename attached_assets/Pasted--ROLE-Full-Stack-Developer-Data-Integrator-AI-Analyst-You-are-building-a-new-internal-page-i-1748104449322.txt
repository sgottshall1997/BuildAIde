üìÑ PAGE NAME:
`/pages/MaterialPrices.jsx` (frontend)  
`/api/material-prices` (backend route)  
Use `lowdb` or `/backend/data/materialPrices.json` to store results

---

üéØ GOAL:
Track and display prices for all major residential construction materials, grouped by trade or use-case. Prices are fetched daily from external sources (FRED API, static industry indices, and retail scraping) and summarized using GPT.

- Structural steel (beams, supports)
- Rebar

**2. CONCRETE & MASONRY**
- Ready-mix concrete (per yd¬≥)
- Concrete blocks (CMU)
- Mortar mix
- Cement bags
- Gravel/base aggregate

**3. DRYWALL & INSULATION**
- Drywall 4x8 sheets
- Joint compound
- Fiberglass batt insulation
- Spray foam insulation

**4. ROOFING**
- Asphalt shingles (per bundle)
- Synthetic underlayment (per roll)
- Roof decking (OSB 7/16")
- Drip edge / flashing

**5. PLUMBING**
- Copper piping (per foot)
- PEX piping (per foot)
- PVC (schedule 40)
- Water heaters (electric/gas)

**6. ELECTRICAL**
- Romex wiring (14/2, 12/2)
- Circuit breakers
- Electrical boxes
- Copper wire (per lb)

**7. FINISHES & INTERIOR**
- Paint (gallon, flat/interior)
- Primer
- Interior doors (6-panel hollow)
- Trim (MDF or pine, per ft)
- Flooring (LVP, tile, hardwood)

**8. WINDOWS & DOORS**
- Vinyl windows (standard size)
- Sliding glass door
- Entry door (steel, prehung)

**9. EXTERIOR**
- Vinyl siding

- Deck boards (composite and PT lumber)
- Fence panels (wood, vinyl)

**10. MISCELLANEOUS**

üîÅ DATA SOURCES:
1. **FRED API (BLS PPI series)** ‚Äî primary for materials like lumber, copper, gypsum
2. **Retail Scraping (Home Depot, Lowe‚Äôs)** ‚Äî OSB, doors, fixtures, common SKU pricing
3. **Static JSON (Construction Analytics / fallback)** ‚Äî use `utils/materialFallback.json` if source fails

---

‚è∞ AUTOMATION:
- Create a **scheduled task that runs daily at 12:01 AM**
- The task should:
  - Pull all current prices from APIs or scrapers
  - Store latest snapshot in `materialPrices.json`
  - Trigger GPT to summarize market trends and projected impacts
  - Save GPT outputs alongside the price data

---

üß† GPT INTEGRATION:
1. **Trend Summary**
   Example:
   > ‚ÄúLumber and OSB prices remained stable this week. Copper surged 9% due to global supply issues.‚Äù

2. **Impact Forecast**
   Example:
   > ‚ÄúExpect higher bids on electrical and plumbing jobs next month due to copper and PEX cost increases.‚Äù
