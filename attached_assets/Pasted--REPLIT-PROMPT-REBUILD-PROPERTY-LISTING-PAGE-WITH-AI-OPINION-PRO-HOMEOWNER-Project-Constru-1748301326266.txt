🧠 REPLIT PROMPT — REBUILD PROPERTY LISTING PAGE WITH AI OPINION (PRO + HOMEOWNER)

Project: ConstructionSmartTools  
Goal: Rebuild the lost Property Listing Page with support for both Pro and Consumer modes, including an “AI Opinion” button on each property with mode-specific GPT prompts.

---

✅ PAGE PATH: `/properties`

Create a new page at `/properties` that displays a list/grid of properties based on current mode (Pro or Consumer). This page should:

- Render a consistent layout across all properties
- Include a button to **“Add New Property”**
- Support different fields per mode (explained below)
- Include an ✨ “AI Opinion” button on each card that fetches a GPT-4o recommendation based on the property details
- Support DEMO_MODE for preloaded property data

---

### 🔁 SHARED FEATURES (For Both Modes):

- Address
- Status (Planning, In Progress, Completed)
- “AI Opinion” button per property
- CTA buttons to relevant tools (based on mode)
- Use consistent card structure (`<PropertyCard />`)
- Each card should include:
  - Title bar with address
  - Badges/tags for project status
  - Icons or buttons to launch tools
  - Modal or expandable panel for AI Opinion output
