🔧 ROLE: Full-Stack Developer + UX Architect + GTM Engineer

You are improving an existing web app called **ConstructionSmartTools** (built with React + TailwindCSS + Node.js + LowDB). The app now supports both professionals (contractors, flippers) and consumers (homeowners, buyers, investors).

You will now finalize both experiences, improve usability, and prepare the product for a beta launch.
