✅ GOAL:

**1. EXPAND THE “PROJECT TYPE” LIST TO BE EXHAUSTIVE AND VERSATILE**

**2. ADD AI-POWERED COST EXPLANATION (GPT OUTPUT)**

Once a user submits the planner form and receives a budget estimate:

✅ Add a **GPT-generated explanation panel** below the estimate with:

- Summary of the estimate range
- Key cost drivers (materials, labor, project scope)
- Neighborhood cost variability (optional if ZIP is collected)
- Optional warning for unexpected variables (e.g. structural surprises, permits)

Example:
> "Your estimated cost of $24,000–$34,000 reflects moderate finish levels and average labor rates. Kitchen remodels are primarily driven by cabinet quality, countertop material, and plumbing updates. Local permit fees and appliance upgrades may affect the final total."

✅ Style the response:
- Use `bg-gray-100`, `p-4`, and `rounded-md`
- Break it into 1–2 short paragraphs with bolded key terms

✅ Add fallback text if GPT is unavailable

---

**3. (Optional) Add Pre-Filled Demo Inputs If in DEMO_MODE**

If `DEMO_MODE=true`, pre-populate the form with:
- Kitchen Remodel
- 250 sq ft
- Midrange finishes
- Timeline: 2 months
