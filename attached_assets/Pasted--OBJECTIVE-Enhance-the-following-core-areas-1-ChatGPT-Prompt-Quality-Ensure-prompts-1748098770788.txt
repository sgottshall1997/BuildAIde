üèóÔ∏è OBJECTIVE: Enhance the following core areas:

1. **ChatGPT Prompt Quality**
   - Ensure prompts use specific construction expert language.
   - Assign GPT the role of a residential construction estimator (20+ years experience in Maryland).
   - Improve cost breakdown explanations with clear, category-specific logic.
   - Add prompt support for "what-if" Q&A follow-ups.

2. **Conversational Estimate Assistant**
   - Make sure GPT can parse natural language descriptions (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm redoing my 400 sq ft kitchen with high-end finishes in 20814‚Äù) into structured form inputs: `{ projectType, squareFootage, finishLevel, timeline, zipCode }`.

3. **PDF Estimate Export**
   - Stub or improve existing logic for generating downloadable PDFs with the cost breakdown and user inputs.
   - Use a clean layout and placeholder logo for Shall‚Äôs Construction.

4. **TailwindCSS Enhancements**
   - Audit existing UI for responsiveness and spacing.
   - Recommend small visual upgrades (e.g., button hover states, mobile spacing).

5. **Cost Logic and API Hooks**
   - Improve the cost estimation logic if hardcoded; allow for scalable JSON structure (e.g., regional multipliers, material cost index).
   - Optionally stub external pricing API integration.

6. **Client Feedback Prompt**
   - Suggest a lightweight way to capture user feedback after estimate generation (e.g., ‚ÄúWas this helpful?‚Äù or 1‚Äì5 star feedback).

üéØ INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return specific code suggestions, improved prompts, and file-level notes.
- Do not generate a full new project ‚Äî just improve the existing codebase.
- Add comments inside any modified code blocks so the developer can understand your changes.
- Use markdown formatting and clearly label each section.

üì¶ CONTEXT:
This tool is built to help a real residential construction company automate bid estimates, permitting workflows, and client communications using AI. The developer is self-taught and wants to make the experience feel smart, professional, and tailored to Maryland-area clients.
