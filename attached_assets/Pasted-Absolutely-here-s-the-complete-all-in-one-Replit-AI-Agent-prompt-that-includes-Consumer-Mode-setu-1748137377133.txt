Absolutely — here’s the complete, all-in-one Replit AI Agent prompt that includes Consumer Mode setup, 3 tools, GPT prompt structure, and UX differences, ready to paste directly into Replit:

✅ REPLIT AI AGENT PROMPT: Add “Consumer Mode” to ConstructionSmartTools (Full Integration)

🔧 ROLE: Full-Stack Developer + UX Architect + GPT Prompt Engineer

You’re expanding a web app called **ConstructionSmartTools** (React + TailwindCSS + Node + LowDB) to support two user types: construction pros and everyday consumers (homeowners, buyers, or investors).

Your goal is to add a **Consumer Mode** that presents a simplified, AI-enhanced version of the platform for non-technical users evaluating home projects. You will not create a new codebase — this is built as a separate mode within the same app.

---

### 🧭 1. ADD MODE SWITCHING

📄 Pages/Components:
- `/pages/HomeConsumer.jsx`
- `/components/ModeToggle.jsx`

🛠 Instructions:
- Add a toggle or landing page split that lets the user choose:
  - “For Homeowners” → `/consumer`
  - “For Pros” → existing app
- Track active mode in session or URL param (`?mode=consumer`)
- Route users to `/consumer-dashboard` if in consumer mode

### 🛠 2. BUILD 3 CONSUMER TOOLS

#### TOOL 1: Home Renovation Cost Estimator

📄 File: `/pages/ConsumerEstimator.jsx`

- Inputs:
  - Project type (kitchen, bath, roof, etc.)
  - Size in square feet
  - Finish level (basic, midrange, high-end)
- Logic:
  - Use `costLogic.json` to calculate range
- Output:
  - Estimated cost range ($X–$Y)
  - Optional per sq. ft.
  - GPT explanation below
- GPT Prompt:
```plaintext
You are a friendly home renovation advisor. A homeowner wants to know what their project might cost. Use the estimate data provided and explain it in simple, encouraging language. Mention key cost drivers if relevant.

TOOL 2: Contractor Quote Analyzer

📄 File: /pages/QuoteCompare.jsx
	•	Inputs:
	•	2 or 3 contractor quotes (structured or pasted text)
	•	GPT Output:
	•	Clear comparison summary
	•	Flags suspicious pricing or omissions
	•	Helps user make a smart choice
	•	GPT Prompt:

You are an experienced contractor helping a homeowner compare quotes. Be honest, helpful, and clear. Point out any red flags or differences, and help them make a smart decision. Explain things simply — no jargon.


⸻

TOOL 3: Flip Potential Advisor (Consumer Edition)

📄 File: /pages/ConsumerFlipAdvisor.jsx
	•	Inputs:
	•	Address
	•	Listing description
	•	Asking price
	•	Square footage
	•	Optional: condition notes
	•	GPT Output:
	•	Location assessment
	•	Renovation scope
	•	Simple verdict
	•	GPT Prompt:

You are an experienced house flipper helping a new investor or homeowner understand whether a property is worth flipping or renovating. Keep it simple, honest, and encouraging — but don't sugarcoat real risks.


⸻

🎨 3. CONSUMER UX DIFFERENCES
	•	Use larger fonts and generous spacing for readability
	•	Avoid construction jargon in labels or GPT responses
	•	Simplify buttons and form inputs
	•	Optional: “Advanced View” toggle for more details

⸻

💡 4. OPTIONAL GPT OUTPUT FORMATTING
	•	Return GPT output as:

{
  "costSummary": "...",
  "redFlags": "...",
  "recommendation": "..."
}

	•	Render in Tailwind-styled boxes with bold section labels

⸻

📌 FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Build a clean, welcoming Consumer Mode by creating /consumer-dashboard with links to the three tools. Keep logic separate from Pro Mode. Do not build login or auth yet — this mode is for demo, lead gen, and future subscription testing.

Once built, let me help you create a consumer-facing landing page, demo script, or lead form. You’re laying the groundwork for two businesses in one.
