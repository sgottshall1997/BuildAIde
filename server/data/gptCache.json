    "response": "### Location & Demand\nWheaton, MD, is a desirable area with solid buyer demand due to its proximity to Washington, D.C. The location provides access to good schools, a variety of amenities, and public transportation options, which are appealing to potential buyers. The fact that this property has been on the market for 58 days suggests there may be room for negotiation, a positive sign for a flipper. Comparable properties in the area have likely been selling at higher prices, especially given the property's $239/sqft pricing, which is below market.\n\n### Renovation Scope\nThe property requires a full interior renovation, including electrical and plumbing updates, which makes it a heavy lift. These updates can be costly and time-consuming, particularly if the systems are outdated or not up to code. A 2-car garage is a nice selling point, but the 1.5 baths could be a limitation; adding a full bathroom might enhance resale value. The lack of photos may indicate there are more issues inside, so a thorough inspection is crucial to uncover any hidden costs, such as structural issues or mold.\n\n### Flipper's Verdict\nThis property has strong potential, especially with the listing being below market value and the possibility of further negotiation. However, the renovation scope is significant, and careful budgeting is critical to ensure profitability. If the numbers work after accounting for renovation costs and potential resale value, it could be a worthwhile pursuit. The key will be managing the renovation efficiently to avoid cost overr",
